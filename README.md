# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList renders an empty list even after a successful API call returning an empty array.  The issue is resolved by explicitly checking for the data array's length before rendering the component.

## Bug Description

The `DataFetch` component fetches data from an API.  If the API returns an empty array, the FlatList incorrectly displays nothing. The component handles loading and error states correctly, but fails to handle the case of an empty data array.

## Solution

The solution involves checking the length of the `data` array before rendering the FlatList. If the array is empty, a message indicating that no data is available is displayed instead of an empty list.
